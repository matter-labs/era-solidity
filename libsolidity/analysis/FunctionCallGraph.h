/**
 * Creates a function call graph for a contract at the granularity of Solidity functions and modifiers.
 * or after deployment. The graph does not preserve temporal relations between calls - edges
 * coming out of the same node show which calls were performed but not in what order.
 *
 * Includes the following special nodes:
 *  - Entry: represents a call from the outside of the contract.
 *    After deployment this is the node that connects to all the functions exposed through the
 *    external interface. At contract creation it connects to the constructors and variable
 *    initializers, which are not explicitly called from within another function.
 *  - InternalDispatch: Represents the internal dispatch function, which calls internal functions
 *    determined at runtime by values of variables and expressions. Functions that are not called
 *    right away get an edge from this node.
 *
 *  Nodes are a variant of either the enum SpecialNode or a CallableDeclaration which currently
 *  can be a function or a modifier. There are no nodes representing event calls. Instead all
 *  emitted events and created contracts are gathered in separate sets included in the graph just
 *  for that purpose.
 *
 *  Auto-generated getter functions for public state variables are ignored, but function calls
 *  inside initial assignments are included in the creation graph.
 *
 *  Only calls reachable from an Entry node are included in the graph. The map representing edges
 *  is also guaranteed to contain keys representing all the reachable functions and modifiers, even
 *  if they have no outgoing edges.
