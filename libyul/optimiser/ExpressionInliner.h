 *  - have a body like r := <functional expression>
 *  - neither reference themselves nor r in the right hand side
 *
 * Furthermore, for all parameters, all of the following need to be true
 *  - the argument is movable
 *  - the parameter is either referenced less than twice in the function body, or the argument is rather cheap
 *    ("cost" of at most 1 like a constant up to 0xff)

 * This component can only be used on sources with unique names.
