/**
 * Optimiser component that modifies an AST in place, turning sequences
 * of variable declarations into complex expressions, if the variables
 * are declared in the right order. This component does the opposite
 * of ExpressionSplitter.
 * Since the order of opcode or function evaluation is unchanged,
 * this transformation does not need to care about conflicting opcodes.
 *
 * Code of the form
 *
 * let a1 := mload(y)
 * let a2 := mul(x, 4)
 * sstore(a2, a1)
 *
 * is transformed into
 *
 * sstore(mul(x, 4), mload(y))
 *
 * The transformation is not applied to loop conditions, because those are
 * evaluated with each loop.
 *
 * The component can be applied to sub-blocks of the AST, you do not
 * need to pass a full AST.
 *
 * Prerequisites: Disambiguator
 *
 * Implementation note: We visit the AST, modifying it in place.
 * The class starts counting references and will only replace variables
 * that have exactly one reference. It keeps a "latest statement pointer"
 * which always points to the statement right before the current statement.
 * Any function call or opcode will reset this pointer. If an identifier
 * is encountered that was declared in the "latest statement", it is replaced
 * by the value of the declaration, the "latest statement" is replaced
 * by an empty block and the pointer is decremented.
 * A block also resets the latest statement pointer.
