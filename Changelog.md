### solc v0.4.17-legacy for zkVM - revision 1.0.0 - Legacy edition

This release has changes in the lowering of EVM assembly in order to get the ZKsync's translator (targeting LLVM IR) to work correctly.

Added:
* A new metadata output field called "extraMetadata" in standard-json that stores information of recursive functions

Changed:
* Internal function pointers are lowered to static jump tables
* Disabled evmasm optimizations to avoid any potential invalidation of the new metadata for recursive functions


### 0.4.17 (2017-09-21)

Features:
 * Assembly Parser: Support multiple assignment (``x, y := f()``).
 * Code Generator: Keep a single copy of encoding functions when using the experimental "ABIEncoderV2".
 * Code Generator: Partial support for passing ``structs`` as arguments and return parameters (requires ``pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;`` for now).

 * General: Added ``.selector`` member on external function types to retrieve their signature.
 * Optimizer: Add new optimization step to remove unused ``JUMPDEST``s.

### 0.4.0 (2016-09-08)

This release deliberately breaks backwards compatibility mostly to
enforce some safety features. The most important change is that you have
to explicitly specify if functions can receive ether via the ``payable``
modifier. Furthermore, more situations cause exceptions to be thrown.

Minimal changes to be made for upgrade:
 - Add ``payable`` to all functions that want to receive Ether
   (including the constructor and the fallback function).
 - Change ``_`` to ``_;`` in modifiers.
 - Add version pragma to each file: ``pragma solidity ^0.4.0;``

Breaking Changes:

 * Source files have to specify the compiler version they are
   compatible with using e.g. ``pragma solidity ^0.4.0;`` or
   ``pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.4.8;``
 * Functions that want to receive Ether have to specify the
   new ``payable`` modifier (otherwise they throw).
 * Contracts that want to receive Ether with a plain "send"
   have to implement a fallback function with the ``payable``
   modifier. Contracts now throw if no payable fallback
   function is defined and no function matches the signature.
 * Failing contract creation through "new" throws.
 * Division / modulus by zero throws.
 * Function call throws if target contract does not have code
 * Modifiers are required to contain ``_`` (use ``if (false) _`` as a workaround if needed).
 * Modifiers: return does not skip part in modifier after ``_``.
 * Placeholder statement `_` in modifier now requires explicit `;`.
 * ``ecrecover`` now returns zero if the input is malformed (it previously returned garbage).
 * The ``constant`` keyword cannot be used for constructors or the fallback function.
 * Removed ``--interface`` (Solidity interface) output option
 * JSON AST: General cleanup, renamed many nodes to match their C++ names.
 * JSON output: ``srcmap-runtime`` renamed to ``srcmapRuntime``.
 * Moved (and reworked) standard library contracts from inside the compiler to github.com/ethereum/solidity/std
   (``import "std";`` or ``import owned;`` do not work anymore).
 * Confusing and undocumented keyword ``after`` was removed.
 * New reserved words: ``abstract``, ``hex``, ``interface``, ``payable``, ``pure``, ``static``, ``view``.

Features:

 * Hexadecimal string literals: ``hex"ab1248fe"``
 * Internal: Inline assembly usable by the code generator.
 * Commandline interface: Using ``-`` as filename allows reading from stdin.
 * Interface JSON: Fallback function is now part of the ABI.
 * Interface: Version string now *semver* compatible.
 * Code generator: Do not provide "new account gas" if we know the called account exists.

Bugfixes:

 * JSON AST: Nodes were added at wrong parent
 * Why3 translator: Crash fix for exponentiation
 * Commandline Interface: linking libraries with underscores in their name.
 * Type Checker: Fallback function cannot return data anymore.
 * Code Generator: Fix crash when ``sha3()`` was used on unsupported types.

Lots of changes to the documentation mainly by voluntary external contributors.
