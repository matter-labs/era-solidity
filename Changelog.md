### solc v0.7.2-legacy for zkVM - revision 1.0.0 - Legacy edition

This release has changes in the lowering of EVM assembly in order to get the ZKsync's translator (targeting LLVM IR) to work correctly.

Added:
* A new metadata output field called "extraMetadata" in standard-json that stores information of recursive functions

Changed:
* Internal function pointers are lowered to static jump tables
* Disabled evmasm optimizations to avoid any potential invalidation of the new metadata for recursive functions
* Minor changes in the control-flow when lowering a try-catch block


### 0.7.2 (2020-09-28)

Important Bugfixes:
 * Type Checker: Disallow two or more free functions with identical name (potentially imported and aliased) and parameter types.


Compiler Features:
 * Export compiler-generated utility sources via standard-json or combined-json.

### 0.5.0 (2018-11-13)

How to update your code:
 * Change every ``.call()`` to a ``.call("")`` and every ``.call(signature, a, b, c)`` to use ``.call(abi.encodeWithSignature(signature, a, b, c))`` (the last one only works for value types).
 * Change every ``keccak256(a, b, c)`` to ``keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b, c))``.
 * Add ``public`` to every function and ``external`` to every fallback or interface function that does not specify its visibility already.
 * Make your fallback functions ``external``.
 * Explicitly state the data location for all variables of struct, array or mapping types (including function parameters), e.g. change ``uint[] x = m_x`` to ``uint[] storage x = m_x``. Note that ``external`` functions require parameters with a data location of ``calldata``.
 * Explicitly convert values of contract type to addresses before using an ``address`` member. Example: if ``c`` is a contract, change ``c.transfer(...)`` to ``address(c).transfer(...)``.
 * Declare variables and especially function arguments as ``address payable``, if you want to call ``transfer`` on them.

Breaking Changes:
 * ABI Encoder: Properly pad data from calldata (``msg.data`` and external function parameters). Use ``abi.encodePacked`` for unpadded encoding.
 * C API (``libsolc`` / raw ``soljson.js``): Removed the ``version``, ``license``, ``compileSingle``, ``compileJSON``, ``compileJSONCallback`` methods
   and replaced them with the ``solidity_license``, ``solidity_version`` and ``solidity_compile`` methods.
 * Code Generator: Signed right shift uses proper arithmetic shift, i.e. rounding towards negative infinity. Warning: this may silently change the semantics of existing code!
 * Code Generator: Revert at runtime if calldata is too short or points out of bounds. This is done inside the ``ABI decoder`` and therefore also applies to ``abi.decode()``.
 * Code Generator: Use ``STATICCALL`` for ``pure`` and ``view`` functions. This was already the case in the experimental 0.5.0 mode.
 * Commandline interface: Remove obsolete ``--formal`` option.
 * Commandline interface: Rename the ``--julia`` option to ``--yul``.
 * Commandline interface: Require ``-`` if standard input is used as source.

### 0.4.0 (2016-09-08)

This release deliberately breaks backwards compatibility mostly to
enforce some safety features. The most important change is that you have
to explicitly specify if functions can receive ether via the ``payable``
modifier. Furthermore, more situations cause exceptions to be thrown.

Minimal changes to be made for upgrade:
 - Add ``payable`` to all functions that want to receive Ether
   (including the constructor and the fallback function).
 - Change ``_`` to ``_;`` in modifiers.
 - Add version pragma to each file: ``pragma solidity ^0.4.0;``

Breaking Changes:

 * Source files have to specify the compiler version they are
   compatible with using e.g. ``pragma solidity ^0.4.0;`` or
   ``pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.4.8;``
 * Functions that want to receive Ether have to specify the
   new ``payable`` modifier (otherwise they throw).
 * Contracts that want to receive Ether with a plain "send"
   have to implement a fallback function with the ``payable``
   modifier. Contracts now throw if no payable fallback
   function is defined and no function matches the signature.
 * Failing contract creation through "new" throws.
 * Division / modulus by zero throws.
 * Function call throws if target contract does not have code
 * Modifiers are required to contain ``_`` (use ``if (false) _`` as a workaround if needed).
 * Modifiers: return does not skip part in modifier after ``_``.
 * Placeholder statement `_` in modifier now requires explicit `;`.
 * ``ecrecover`` now returns zero if the input is malformed (it previously returned garbage).
 * The ``constant`` keyword cannot be used for constructors or the fallback function.
 * Removed ``--interface`` (Solidity interface) output option
 * JSON AST: General cleanup, renamed many nodes to match their C++ names.
 * JSON output: ``srcmap-runtime`` renamed to ``srcmapRuntime``.
 * Moved (and reworked) standard library contracts from inside the compiler to github.com/ethereum/solidity/std
   (``import "std";`` or ``import owned;`` do not work anymore).
 * Confusing and undocumented keyword ``after`` was removed.
 * New reserved words: ``abstract``, ``hex``, ``interface``, ``payable``, ``pure``, ``static``, ``view``.

Features:

 * Hexadecimal string literals: ``hex"ab1248fe"``
 * Internal: Inline assembly usable by the code generator.
 * Commandline interface: Using ``-`` as filename allows reading from stdin.
 * Interface JSON: Fallback function is now part of the ABI.
 * Interface: Version string now *semver* compatible.
 * Code generator: Do not provide "new account gas" if we know the called account exists.

Bugfixes:

 * JSON AST: Nodes were added at wrong parent
 * Why3 translator: Crash fix for exponentiation
 * Commandline Interface: linking libraries with underscores in their name.
 * Type Checker: Fallback function cannot return data anymore.
 * Code Generator: Fix crash when ``sha3()`` was used on unsupported types.

 * Allow internal library functions to be called (by "inlining")
 * Fractional/rational constants (only usable with fixed point types, which are still in progress)
 * Inline assembly has access to internal functions (as jump labels)
 * Running `solc` without arguments on a terminal will print help.
 * Bugfix: Remove some non-determinism in code generation.
 * Bugfix: Corrected usage of not / bnot / iszero in inline assembly
 * Bugfix: Correctly clean bytesNN types before comparison

### 0.3.2 (2016-04-18)

 * Bugfix: Inline assembly parser: `byte` opcode was unusable
 * Bugfix: Error reporting: tokens for variably-sized types were not converted to string properly
 * Bugfix: Dynamic arrays of structs were not deleted correctly.
 * Bugfix: Static arrays in constructor parameter list were not decoded correctly.

### 0.3.1 (2016-03-31)

 * Inline assembly
 * Bugfix: Code generation: array access with narrow types did not clean higher order bits
 * Bugfix: Error reporting: error reporting with unknown source location caused a crash

### 0.3.0 (2016-03-11)

BREAKING CHANGES:

 * Added new keywords `assembly`, `foreign`, `fixed`, `ufixed`, `fixedNxM`, `ufixedNxM` (for various values of M and N), `timestamp`
 * Number constant division does not round to integer, but to a fixed point type (e.g. `1 / 2 != 1`, but `1 / 2 == 0.5`).
 * Library calls now default to use DELEGATECALL (e.g. called library functions see the same value as the calling function for `msg.value` and `msg.sender`).
 * `<address>.delegatecall` as a low-level calling interface

Bugfixes:
 * Fixed a bug in the optimizer that resulted in comparisons being wrong.


### 0.2.2 (2016-02-17)

 * Index access for types `bytes1`, ..., `bytes32` (only read access for now).
 * Bugfix: Type checker crash for wrong number of base constructor parameters.

### 0.2.1 (2016-01-30)

 * Inline arrays, i.e. `var y = [1,x,f()];` if there is a common type for `1`, `x` and `f()`. Note that the result is always a fixed-length memory array and conversion to dynamic-length memory arrays is not yet possible.
 * Import similar to ECMAScript6 import (`import "abc.sol" as d` and `import {x, y} from "abc.sol"`).
 * Commandline compiler solc automatically resolves missing imports and allows for "include directories".
 * Conditional: `x ? y : z`
 * Bugfix: Fixed several bugs where the optimizer generated invalid code.
 * Bugfix: Enums and structs were not accessible to other contracts.
 * Bugfix: Fixed segfault connected to function parameter types, appeared during gas estimation.
 * Bugfix: Type checker crash for wrong number of base constructor parameters.
 * Bugfix: Allow function overloads with different array types.
 * Bugfix: Allow assignments of type `(x) = 7`.
 * Bugfix: Type `uint176` was not available.
 * Bugfix: Fixed crash during type checking concerning constructor calls.
 * Bugfix: Fixed crash during code generation concerning invalid accessors for struct types.
 * Bugfix: Fixed crash during code generating concerning computing a hash of a struct type.

### 0.2.0 (2015-12-02)

 * **Breaking Change**: `new ContractName.value(10)()` has to be written as `(new ContractName).value(10)()`
 * Added `selfdestruct` as an alias for `suicide`.
 * Allocation of memory arrays using `new`.
 * Binding library functions to types via `using x for y`
 * `addmod` and `mulmod` (modular addition and modular multiplication with arbitrary intermediate precision)
 * Bugfix: Constructor arguments of fixed array type were not read correctly.
 * Bugfix: Memory allocation of structs containing arrays or strings.
 * Bugfix: Data location for explicit memory parameters in libraries was set to storage.

### 0.1.7 (2015-11-17)

 * Improved error messages for unexpected tokens.
 * Proof-of-concept transcompilation to why3 for formal verification of contracts.

 * Bugfix: Writing to elements of `bytes` or `string` overwrite others.
 * Bugfix: "Successor block not found" on Windows.
 * Bugfix: Using string literals in tuples.
 * Bugfix: Cope with invalid commit hash in version for libraries.
 * Bugfix: Some test framework fixes on windows.

### 0.1.6 (2015-10-16)

 * `.push()` for dynamic storage arrays.
 * Tuple expressions (`(1,2,3)` or `return (1,2,3);`)
 * Declaration and assignment of multiple variables (`var (x,y,) = (1,2,3,4,5);` or `var (x,y) = f();`)
 * Destructuring assignment (`(x,y,) = (1,2,3)`)
 * Bugfix: Internal error about usage of library function with invalid types.
 * Bugfix: Correctly parse `Library.structType a` at statement level.
 * Bugfix: Correctly report source locations of parenthesized expressions (as part of "tuple" story).

### 0.1.5 (2015-10-07)

 * Breaking change in storage encoding: Encode short byte arrays and strings together with their length in storage.
 * Report warnings
 * Allow storage reference types for public library functions.
 * Access to types declared in other contracts and libraries via `.`.
